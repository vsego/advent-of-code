# Day 7: [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)

Perl was my main language for quite a few years. I always liked how I could
make weird chunks of text that do my bidding. As a friend of mine said once:
"Bash your head on the keyboard and you'll get a Perl program that does
_something_".

However, when I went back to some of the code I written years before, it was
far less fun. Not surprisingly, most of the programs would've been easier to
rewrite than to read and figure out what and how they do.

Still, it was nice to go back to Perl. To honour the tradition, I made _some_
effort to make it not-too-readable, but it's far from the ideal of obfuscated
Perl code that some people achieve (see examples
[here](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1597)).

I had a bit of a trouble with the problem itself. In essence, this defines a
[partial ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set), and
then asks to do sorting under some constraints. I wanted to avoid creating all
pairs of related tasks and instead just use the graph as it is, which is not
too insane, but it did complicate things a bit.

As with Pascal, it was nice to revisit Perl, but I really don't miss it. Maybe
I should've gone with Perl 6, for extra challenge.
