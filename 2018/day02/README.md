# Day 2: [Go](https://golang.org/)

I had no contact with Go before and, having heard of it, I was looking forward
to this. I mean, mighty Google made a language that is getting some nice
reviews and seems to be growing in popularity... what's not to like?

In the end, I didn't particularly enjoy it. I'd probably need more than just a
one-off experience, but Go simply doesn't feel like it's providing enough
improvements over other languages to warrant a whole new language.

Also, somewhat strong typing gave me some trouble, but that may be due to me
using Python - and before that Perl and PHP - for many years now.

The problem itself wasn't particularly hard. Maybe I should redo this one in
SQL and give Go another go in some of the later problems.
