Day 16: [D](https://dlang.org/)

Tis was the second of my two most pleasant discoveries among new languages (the
first one being Groovy, the day before). This language is for C++ what Groovy
for Java. It has some typing, but it's not overly constraining, so it felt like
a C++/Python crossover.

I solved the problem in a way quite similar to what I'd do in Python, which is
a nice thing to be able to do in a compiled language. Some Google-fu was
needed, of course, but I've had no real trouble with it.

Solving the problem was fairly straight-forward, and I really liked how tightly
the input for the part 1 was set. After filtering out all the possibilities,
only one opcode's instruction was clear. So, a system of elimination was needed
above the initial filtering. Not a bit problematic, but also not completely
trivial.
