Day 13: [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

I first used Javascript on [Netscape
Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) (version 1.1 or
2.0, I'm not sure anymore). Yes, I am **that** old. :-) Then I had a few years
of hiatus and, when I got back to it, it looked unrecognisable (still, years
before TypeScript and similar stuff). It felt like a real language, capable of
doing more than just swapping images and changing status line text.

I tried various frameworks and libraries, from the quite pleasant
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to monstrosities like
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). I still like pure JavaScript (with jQuery,
to make my life easier), but I cannot stand the modern, bloated and often
confusing frameworks. But, then again, there is a reason why I stick to back
end programming. :-)

Using JavaScript for this one was a cheap shot. No big challenges
language-wise, so I could focus on the problem at hand, and this one was quite
straightforward. No big hurdles or anything. Just follow what the problem says
and that's about it.
