# Day 8: [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)

Octave is often referred to as "free
[Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)". Despite being a
numerical mathematician, I actually used Matlab very little, as I prefered
writing my code in free, openly accessible languages. So, my choice was usually
Python with [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), except when it was Perl and I
think that my PhD supervisor still hates me a bit because of that one. :-)

The faculties I worked with while I was in academia all had Matlab license, so
there was no need for me to "downgrade" to Octave, but for this one I wanted to
give it a shot. It's not like my previous experience would give me any
significant edge in Matlab.

I've had some confusions here, but nothing that a bit of Googling wouldn't sort
out. The problem itself is a simple, recursive one, requiring only to play with
indices in an array. Not overly challenging, which was made up for by writing
it in a language I've used for the first time.
