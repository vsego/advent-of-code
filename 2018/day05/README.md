# Day 5: [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language))

Pascal was my first ever "serious" language, after C64 Basic and, later,
GWBasic on my first PC. After a few years of Turbo/Borland Pascal, I switched
to Delphi, with which I stayed until abandoning Windows altogether (my last Win
was 2000). For this problem, I used [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/).

I was really looking forward to this, and I wasn't disappointed. Despite it's
shortcomings, for which I wouldn't pick Pascal for any real project these days,
this was quite pleasant. It was nice to see that it supports long strings,
something that made my life sooo much easier in Delphi, compared to Pascal.

Otherwise, it took some effort to remember things, but the scale of the problem
was low enough to make this pleasant. I wonder if I should've used a more
obscure language here, keeping Pascal for later problems.

Probably not. :-)
