# Day 3: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

Back to basics (not Basic; that'll come later) with this one. I used to use and
teach C for many years, and this made for a nice blast from the past.

My main concern with the good ol' C is that it doesn't natively support regexes
and string manipulation is mostly unpleasant, making it a bit limiting in terms
of what kinds of input I'd want to deal with.

Luckily, the input here is easy enough to handle with mere `scanf` and the rest
of the task is fairly simple.

**Bonus:** this readme's long  lines all turned out to be exactly 79 chars, and
that wraps nicely in my vim, with 79 chars width marker for Python styling. :-)
