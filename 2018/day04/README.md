# Day 4: [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)

I had a short brush with Lua many years ago, when I played a silly little
volleyball game [Blobby Volley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blobby_Volley).
The characters were programmable and Lua was a natural choice for that. At the
time, I just played with modifying the existing players' logic and I was
looking forward to giving Lua a proper run.

I was not exactly impressed by the language, but I didn't dislike it either. As
expected, it's much more developed and powerful than I remembered from that one
simple example, and Google was all I needed to tackle this. I'd consider using
the language if I needed to embed one in a project, which is how it's usually
used.

The problem itself gave me a bit of headache because I wasn't reading it
carefully, but otherwise it was a nice one, not too complex for writing it in a
language I was practically using for the first time.
