# [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

Inspired by [Thomas ten Cate](https://github.com/ttencate/) who did each
problem of [AoC 2016](https://github.com/ttencate/aoc2016) and [AoC
2017](https://github.com/ttencate/aoc2017) in its own  language, I decided to
go for some similar fun. Initially, I expected to go at it for a week or,
maybe, 10ish days, but I managed to do it a bit longer.

Here is the list of languages I used (some comments are available in each
problem's `README.md`):

* [Day 1](day01/): `bash`
* [Day 2](day02/): Go
* [Day 3](day03/): C
* [Day 4](day04/): Lua
* [Day 5](day05/): Free Pascal
* [Day 6](day06/): Wolfram Mathematica
* [Day 7](day07/): Perl
* [Day 8](day08/): Octave
* [Day 9](day09/): C++
* [Day 10](day10/): Julia
* [Day 11](day11/): Scilab (alternative in PostgreSQL)
* [Day 12](day12/): PHP
* [Day 13](day13/): JavaScript
* [Day 14](day14/): Java
* [Day 15](day15/): Groovy
* [Day 16](day16/): D
* [Day 17](day17/): Gambas
* [Day 18](day18/): Rust
* [Day 19](day19/): Kotlin
* [Day 20](day20/): NewLISP
* [Day 21](day21/): Nim
* [Day 22](day22/): -
* [Day 23](day23/): -
* [Day 24](day24/): -
* [Day 25](day25/): -

I haven't given up yet. :-) I'm just very short with time, so the remaining few
might take a while longer... or I might actually give up on them.
