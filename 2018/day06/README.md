Day 6: [Wolfram Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)

Mathematica is the only non-free, proprietary language I used in this
challenge. I used to use it a lot when I worked in academia, but not at all
since then. I still have access to some servers that have the license on it,
but SSHing there meant that GUI would be unpleasant, so I made a simple text
file that can be fed directly to Mathematica's CLI `math`.

The choice of the problem to tackle with Mathematica may not have been the
best, or maybe I'm just out of touch. Mathematica is a functional language, and
bulky chunks of code with `while` and `for` loops are not really the way it's
supposed to be written. Still, it made for a nice challenge, not trivial, but
definitely not too hard.
